<b>Use All Materials</br></b>
When Use All Materials is checked the add-on will assign materials based on all materials in the scene.

<b>Prefix</b></br>
Using a prefix in your material names(e.g. <b>rand_</b>Material) and then pasting it into the prefix field will search the scene for all materials with that prefix in the name. The add-on then only assigns materials with the prefix.
